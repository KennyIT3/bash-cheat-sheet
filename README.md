## Introduction

### What is bash?

"Bash" is **B**ourne **A**gain **SH**ell. It's a command language interpreter for the GNU operating system that executes commands from the standard input (STDIN) and is capable to run commands from a file (called a shell script).

### Where Bash scripts run?

When we run a script, the Bash process starts a new process in which the script runs.

For example, if we have three terminals, and each runs a command, there will be *three* processes running the command.

### The Shebang ðŸ™Œ

When we execute a command, the OS needs to know how to execute it. The Shebang is a path to the Bash interpreter. For example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
```

Note that it doesn't have to be an absolute path, but since you'll be running your script from different locations, providing the absolute path would be the safest option.

Once the **first** line is set to `#!/bin/bash`, the content of the script will be passed to the `/bin/bash` program to be executed.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo $PATH
```

If we now run  `./test.sh`, the `echo $PATH` command will be passed to the `/bin/bash` program, which is the same as running:

```bash
/bin/bash test.sh
```

## Variables

Variables are used to hold information. Theur purpose is to label and store data in memory, which will be used throughout the program you write.

### Setting / Reading variables

Bash variables don't have to be declared. You can have a varialbe by simply assigning a value to its reference.

```bash
#!/bin/bash
str="hello world!"
echo $str
```

The second line above creates a variable called `str`, and assigns the string "hello world" to it. Then the *value* of the `str` variable is retrieved by adding `$` to the variable's name. NOTE: If you ommit the `$` and use `echo str`, the "str" string will be echoed.

> "A quote"

When we want to assign a single word to variable, we don't need any quotes. The following command works just fine:

```bash
name=maroun
```

However, if we want to store more complex values,we need to use quotes.

There are two types of quotes: `'` (single quote), and `"` (double quotes).

*Single quotes* treats every character **literally**, whereas *double quotes* allows **substitution**. This snippet dempnstrates the difference:

```bash
var=world
echo "hello $var"
echo 'hello $var'
```

The output would be:

```
hello world
hello $var
```


#### Command substitution

Allows us to take an output of a command, and assign it to a variable. This happens when a command is enclosed as `$(command)` or `` `command` ``.

Bash executes the command in a subshell environment, and replaces the command substitution with the standard output of the command.

the `$(command)` form is preferred over the backticks one, as it's the newer POSIX form. If this reason is not enough, you should compare the following two, and decide which one is more readable:

```bash
echo $(echo $(echo hello))
echo `echo \`echo hello\``
```

### Special variables

Bash has some built in variables. The following list sums up these variables:

| Variable | Description   |
| :---     | :---          |
| `$0`     | The name of the file that's running the current script |
| `$n`     | Arguments with which the script was invoked (`$1` is the first argument, `$2` is the second and so on)  |
| `$$`     | The process ID of the current shell  |
| `$!`     | The process ID of the last background command  |
| `$@`     | All arguments passed to the script  |
| `$#`     | Number of arguments passed to the script  |
| `$?`     | The exit status of the most recently process  |
| `$_`     | The last argument of the last command  |

### Command line arguments

You are already familiar with command line arguments, and you've probably used it many times before. For example, when we use the command:

```bash
ls -l /etc
```

we're actually providing two arguments for the `ls` program. The first one (`$1`) is the `-l` flag, and the second one (`$2`) is the file destination, `/etc`.

As we saw in the table above, `$n` holds the arguments with which the script was invoked. For example, if we write the script `example.sh`:

```bash
First argument is $1, second one is $2
```

Now when we run `./example.sh Hello World!`, we'll get the output

> First argument is Hello, second one is World!

### Exporting variables

Since scripts run in their own process, variables are also limited to the process in which they run.

In some cases, you would want to break your script to multiple scripts, and run one from another. Consider this example:

```bash
# a.sh
var=hello
./b.sh
```

```bash
# b.sh
echo $var
```
We'll not get anything printed to the console. That's because `var` variable is unknown in the subprocess that `b.sh` runs inside.

To overcome this problem, we use the `export` keyword:

```bash
# a.sh
var=hello
export var
./b.sh
```

Now, `var` is "exported" and is available in the second script.

**Important note!**

The `var` in the second script is just a copy of the variable, changing it inside `b.sh` has no impact on the original varialbe in `a.sh`! The snippet below should demonstrate the issue:

```bash
# a.sh
var=hello
export var
./b.sh
echo $var
```

```bash
# b.sh
var=world
```

If we run `./a.sh`, we'll get "hello" printed, and not "world".

### Types of variables

So far, we didn't care much about the variables' type. The variables we saw could contain any value we assign to them. For example:

```bash
var=hello
var=4
var=$(date)
var=2.3
```

In some cases, you might want to make a constant variable, or assign only integers to it.

Introducing the `declare` built-in keyword!

`declare` allows us to limit the value assigned to a variable. Some of its option:

| Option   | Description       |
| :---     | :---              |
| -a       | Array variable    |
| -i       | Integer variable  |
| -r       | Read only variable |
| -u       | All characters converted to uper-case |
| -l       | All characters converted to lower-case |

The code below will provide a good explanation of the usage:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
declare -i i=5
echo $i
i=str
echo $i
declare -l s=HELLO
echo $s
declare -p s
declare -ai arr=(9 2 3 4 5)
arr[0]=1
echo ${arr[*]}
# declare -r c=const
# r=hello 
```

Run `./test.sh`:

```
5
0
hello
declare -l s="hello"
1 2 3 4 5
```

If we uncomment the last two lines, we'll get an error saying that we're trying to assign to a readonly variable:

>./test.sh: line 10: r: readonly variable

### Arrays variables

Array is simply a variable holding multiple values, of the same type or different types.

Bash provides one dimentional indexed and associative array variables. There is no max limit on the size of an array.

To explicitly declare an array, we use:

```bash
declare -a array_var
```

It's also possible to create an array using compound assignments in the following format:

```bash
array_var=(value1 value2 value3 ... valueN)
```

#### Dereferencing the variables

We use curly braces in order to access an element. The following example should provide a good explanation:

```bash
arr=(1 2 3 4 5 6)
echo ${arr[*]}  # prints 1 2 3 4 5 6
echo $arr[*]    # prints 1[*] ($arr prints 1, then the chars [*] are printed)
echo ${arr[4]}  # prints 5 (arrays are zero-based)
echo ${#arr[@]} # prints 6
```

### Functions

Bash functions are used to group commands, using a single name for the group.
When executing a function, the command are executed one by one, in the order they appear.

The syntax for creating a function:

```bash
[function] name () { commands; }
```

Note that the `function` keyword is optional, and the curly braces must be separated from the function's body by a space of blanks.

Fcuntions are executed within the *current* shell context, not in a new subprocess.

#### Arguments

Within the function, the arguments are stored in `$1`, `$2`, ..., `$N` variables. For example:

```bash
greet() {
    echo You passed $# arguments!
    echo Hello $*
    echo Hello $1 $2!
}

greet Maroun Bassam
```

This will print:

```
You passed 2 arguments
Hello Maroun Bassam
Hello Maroun Bassam!
```

#### Scope of variables

A Bash variable can be declared as `local`, which means that it is visible only within the block in which it appears. For example:

```bash
function test {
    local loc_var=100
    echo $local_var
}
test
echo $local_var
```

Only 100 will be echoed - the `echo` outside the function doesn't know what `local_var` is, and a blank value will be printed.

If we remove the `local` keyword, and run the script again, we'll get 100 printed twice.

#### Return codes

A script in Linux can be terminated using the `exit` command. There are [255 different error codes](http://tldp.org/LDP/abs/html/exitcodes.html), while 0 means success.

For example, the `grep` command returns 0 if a match was found:

```bash
echo hello | grep -q h
echo $?
# prints 0
echo hello | grep -q z
echo $?
# prints 1
```

If you don't return a value explicitly in a script, the exist status of the last command that the script executed is returned. For example, the following script returns the exit status of `some_command`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
some_command
```

while the following script returns 0:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
function test {
    cat non_existing_file
}
test
echo "I'm visible"
exit 0
```

We can use `set -e` if we want the script to exit if a command fails:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
set -e
function test {
    cat non_existing_file
}
test
echo "I'm invisible"
exit 0
```

The script above will not reach the last line and will return 1.

### Input

We already saw how to provide arguments to a Bash script. In this section, we will show how to ask the user to provide arguments to your script.

#### Asking user for input

The command `read` asks the user for input. It takes the input and stores it to a variable.

```bash
echo "Please insert your name: "
read name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

You can also use the `-p` flag:

```bash
read -p "Please insert your name: " name
echo "Hello, $name!"
```

The `-s` flag will hide the user's input. It's used when a sensetive data is requested:

```bash
read -ps "Please insert your password: " pwd
```

It's also possible to ask for multiple inputs:

```bash
echo "What are your favorite colors?"
read c1 c2 c3
```

This will tell `read` that more than one input is expected. It'll split the input passed by the user by space and assign to the variables accordingly.
